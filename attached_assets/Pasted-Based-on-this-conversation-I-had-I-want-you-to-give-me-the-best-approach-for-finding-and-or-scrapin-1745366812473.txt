Based on this conversation I had, I want you to give me the best approach for finding and/or scraping data. I wnat you to give me steps to finish this project so that I can show off my skills and potentially expand this project. Make this project doable. help me come up with ideas for an app or website that people in my home country ethiopia can benefit off of. I want this to be a personal project that shows off my coding skill s but also my ability to reach out to the communityEditI'd be happy to help you brainstorm ideas for an app or website that could benefit people in Ethiopia while showcasing your coding skills and community engagement. Let me suggest a focused concept that could have real impact:
Agricultural Market Connection Platform
Ethiopia has a strong agricultural economy, with many small-scale farmers who sometimes struggle to connect directly with buyers. You could create a platform that:

Connects small-scale farmers directly with buyers (eliminating middlemen)
Provides real-time market price information
Offers weather forecasts and farming advice
Includes a simple inventory management system
Works via both web and SMS for those with limited internet access

This concept would:

Solve a real economic need
Support Ethiopia's largest industry
Demonstrate technical skills in creating both web and mobile interfaces
Show your understanding of local challenges and opportunities
Potentially create measurable economic impact

Would you like me to elaborate on this concept, suggest alternative ideas that might address different community needs, or discuss the technical implementation approach?RetryAelaborate on this ideaEditAgricultural Market Connection Platform for Ethiopia
Let me elaborate on this concept, exploring how it could benefit Ethiopian communities while showcasing your technical skills:
Core Features
1. Farmer-Buyer Direct Connection
Create a marketplace where farmers can list their products and buyers can discover them directly. This eliminates intermediaries who often capture significant portions of the value chain, increasing farmer income while potentially lowering consumer prices.
2. Real-time Market Information
Develop a system that aggregates and displays current market prices across different regions in Ethiopia. This helps farmers make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce, preventing exploitation due to information asymmetry.
3. Multi-platform Accessibility
Design the platform to work on:

Web interface for smartphone users
USSD/SMS service for basic phones
Offline capabilities with periodic syncing for areas with limited connectivity
Voice interface in multiple Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, etc.)

4. Educational Resources
Include farming best practices, seasonal planting guides, and pest management information tailored to Ethiopia's diverse agricultural zones.
Technical Implementation
The project would demonstrate multiple technical skills:

Frontend: Create a responsive web app using modern frameworks (React, Vue.js)
Backend: Build a robust API (Node.js, Django, etc.)
Database: Design efficient data structures for product listings, user profiles, and transactions
SMS Integration: Connect with telecom APIs for the SMS service
Geolocation: Implement mapping to show nearby buyers/sellers
Offline Sync: Develop sophisticated data synchronization for intermittent connections
Analytics Dashboard: Show market trends and price forecasting

Community Impact
This platform could directly address several challenges in Ethiopia:

Help small-scale farmers increase their income through better price negotiation
Reduce post-harvest losses by connecting farmers to buyers more efficiently
Improve food security by making the supply chain more transparent
Create digital literacy opportunities as users engage with the platform

Growth Potential
Start with a pilot in one region focusing on key crops, then expand to:

Additional regions across Ethiopia
More diverse agricultural products
Integration with microfinance services
Connection with export markets

Showcasing Your Skills
This project demonstrates not just coding ability but also:

User research and community understanding
Solving real-world problems with appropriate technology
Designing for accessibility and diverse user needs
Creating sustainable solutions with measurable impact

Would you like to focus on a particular aspect of this concept, or would you prefer to explore alternative project ideas that might better match your specific technical interests or community priorities?RetryAcan you hone this down to something doable within a weeks time. I want an MVP, also how would I address getting most of the data yo umentioned to me like this for example: 2. Real-time Market Information
Develop a system that aggregates and displays current market prices across different regions in Ethiopia. This helps farmers make informed decisions about when and where to sell their produce, preventing exploitation due to information asymmetry.EditEthiopian Agricultural Market MVP: One-Week Project Plan
I'll narrow down the agricultural market platform to a focused MVP that you could build in a week, and address the data question.
One-Week MVP: Farm2Market Ethiopia
Core Features (Simplified)

Basic Product Listing Platform

Simple registration for farmers and buyers
Ability to list/search agricultural products
Contact mechanism between parties

Addressing the Market Data Challenge
For real-time market information in your MVP, I recommend these approaches:

Manual Data Collection (MVP Approach)

Partner with 2-3 local markets and collect price data manually once or twice a week
Input this data yourself during the MVP phase
This proves the concept without requiring complex data infrastructure


Leverage Existing Sources

Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) publishes some price data you could manually reference
Ministry of Agriculture may have accessible data


Crowdsourced Approach

Allow trusted users (farmers/buyers) to report prices they encounter
Implement a simple validation system (e.g., require multiple reports before publishing)


Strategic Partnerships

Reach out to NGOs already collecting this data like Digital Green or Farm Africa
Contact agricultural extension offices in your target region
These organizations might be willing to share some basic data for a community project



Implementation Plan
Day 1-2: Setup & Core Features

Project initialization, repository setup
Basic user authentication
Simple product listing functionality

To help you build the most effective MVP and scrape or collect relevant data for Ethiopian agricultural market prices, could you clarify a few things:

Which regions or markets in Ethiopia would you like to focus on for your MVP? (e.g., Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Hawassa)

Are there specific crops or commodities you'd like to start with (e.g., teff, maize, coffee)?

Would you prefer to scrape data from existing online sources, or are you open to starting with manual or crowdsourced data collection?

Do you want suggestions for public APIs, datasets, or platforms (like ECX or government sources) that might offer price or agriculture data?

Once I have this info, I can help you find the best sources and steps for gathering and using this data in your project.

You said:
You can focus on Addis Abeba for now to make it simpler. We can start off with teff. You can start with manual/crowdsourced data. You can give me the most viable data you feel I would need

ChatGPT said:
Great! I’ll look into the most viable sources and methods for gathering market price data for teff in Addis Ababa. This will include public datasets, agricultural bulletins, and any platforms that provide market updates—especially those that could support a manual or crowdsourced collection model.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the best options you can use in your MVP.

Teff Price Data Sources in Addis Ababa
Government and Official Sources
Ethiopian Grain Trade Enterprise (EGTE) – EGTE is a government grain marketing enterprise that collects monthly wholesale prices for staples (including teff) in Addis Ababa and other markets. These prices are published on EGTE’s Market Information System website as tables​
gatesopenresearch.org
. The data is fairly structured (e.g. sortable tables or downloadable reports) and updated monthly. An MVP could integrate this by manually scraping the EGTE site or copying the posted CSV/tables each month (since the data is already tabulated and trustworthy​
gatesopenresearch.org
).
Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) – The ECX provides daily market prices for commodities via its trading platform. While ECX mainly trades export crops (coffee, sesame, pulses, etc.), teff was slated as one of its target commodities​
future-agricultures.org
. ECX disseminates prices in real-time through electronic tickers, a website, and an SMS hotline (users can call 929 or text 934 to get the latest market prices)​
ecx.com.et
. Data from ECX is structured (daily price listings by grade/warehouse). For an MVP, one could manually check the ECX website or use the SMS service and input the teff price if/when teff is traded. (Note: If teff isn’t actively traded on ECX, this source may not have frequent teff data, but ECX’s model shows how official real-time price info can be accessed.)
Ministry of Agriculture / Trade Bulletins – Government ministries sometimes release market price updates through reports or press releases. For example, the Addis Ababa Trade Bureau monitors retail grain prices in the city; a recent Bureau report noted a 37% year-on-year increase in teff prices​
addisfortune.news
. The national Central Statistics Agency (CSA) also collects retail price data from markets (used for inflation/CPI reports). These official datasets are reliable but often unstructured (embedded in PDFs or press articles). An MVP could incorporate them by manually extracting key figures from monthly reports or news bulletins and updating the platform weekly.
NGO and Development Organization Sources
FEWS NET Price Bulletins – The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (funded by USAID) publishes monthly Price Bulletins for Ethiopia. These bulletins (available via ReliefWeb) track staple food prices in key markets, often including a chart for teff in Addis Ababa​
reliefweb.int
. They are trusted and updated monthly, though the data is in PDF/chart format. An MVP could use these as a reference for trends, or manually pull out the Addis teff price from the charts each month for a historical view.
WFP “Market Watch” Reports – The World Food Programme’s Ethiopia office releases Monthly Market Watch reports. These cover market prices of cereals like teff, with analyses of price changes and supply conditions. For instance, WFP noted teff hitting record highs in early 2023 in Addis. The data is high-quality but in narrative/PDF form (unstructured text and graphs). Integration would require manually reading the report or using a simple scraper to find the teff price in Addis Ababa each month. Still, these reports are useful for weekly trend context and are fairly regular (monthly updates).
Farm Africa’s Market Initiatives – NGOs like Farm Africa have projects to improve farmers’ market access. Farm Africa recently piloted a “Farmer App” that let 1,300 farmers monitor market selling prices from their phones​
farmafrica.org
. While not a public dataset, it shows that NGOs are gathering local price info (often via crowdsourcing SMS). An MVP could partner with such projects or use their approach: e.g. have cooperatives or farmers’ groups report teff prices weekly via a phone app. Data from these initiatives can be structured (if the app has a database) or semi-structured (SMS feeds), and they tend to focus on timely, weekly or even daily updates within the project areas.
Digital Green & Others – Organizations like Digital Green and Precision Agriculture for Development (PxD) work on digital farmer advisory services in Ethiopia. They sometimes disseminate market price information via voice or SMS as part of their advice. While they may not publish standalone price bulletins, they are potential sources of crowdsourced price data (e.g. if they run a program where farmers share what price they sold teff at in Addis markets). An MVP could leverage such networks by asking these organizations for data-sharing or by subscribing to any SMS advisories that include prices. The data here would likely be unstructured text (messages or anecdotes) but could be regularly updated through farmer feedback loops.
Local Market and Crowdsourced Channels
Local Market Boards & Markets – In Addis Ababa’s big grain markets (like the Ehil Berenda central market), prices for different teff grades are often known informally each day. Sometimes market boards or cooperative offices will post the day’s buying/selling rates. For an MVP, these on-the-ground prices can be gathered via crowdsourcing – e.g. having a market seller or observer take a photo of the price board or send in the price of “red teff” vs “white teff” that day. This data is highly granular and updated daily/weekly, though completely manual. It would come in unstructured (a photo or message), but the platform could structure it by inputting those numbers into a database each week. This approach ensures real-time local accuracy if a reliable volunteer network is in place.
Social Media Groups and Forums – Ethiopian traders and consumers often discuss prices on social platforms. There are Facebook groups and Telegram/WhatsApp channels where people ask about and share current market prices for grains. For example, a WhatsApp group of teff traders in Addis might share that “teff (white, first grade) is selling for 8,000 Birr/quintal this week”. An MVP could tap into these informal channels by joining groups or following threads on local forums. Integration might involve manually monitoring these groups or deploying a bot to scrape messages for price numbers. However, the data will be unstructured text and requires verification. Still, it’s a very accessible, crowdsourced way to get up-to-date weekly price info straight from the market buzz.
Local Radio and Market Info Hotlines – In some cases, local radio stations or hotline services announce market prices. Farmers in regions around Addis may call in to learn the day’s teff price. If such services exist (for example, community radio or an IVR system), an MVP team member could retrieve the prices weekly and input them. This is another form of crowdsourced update – essentially manually pulling data from an audio report. It’s informal but can be quite up-to-date. The data format here is unstructured (audio that needs to be heard and transcribed), but it’s an accessible source in the absence of written reports.
Existing Platforms and Apps Aggregating Prices
Tridge – Tridge is a global agriculture data platform that provides price data for teff in Ethiopia. It aggregates wholesale and farmgate prices from “trusted local sources” and shows trends by region​
tridge.com
. For example, Tridge might list the latest wholesale price of teff in Addis or other zones (with entries like “Teff – Addis Ababa – X USD/kg on [date]”). The data on Tridge is presented in a structured way on their website, and often updated monthly or quarterly. An MVP could reference Tridge’s website for baseline numbers or even scrape it (though Tridge may require a login for detailed data). It’s useful for historical comparison and seeing regional differences, and is considered reliable since it compiles official and market information​
tridge.com
.
Selina Wamucii Price Portal – Selina Wamucii’s market insights portal provides daily updated price ranges for various commodities. They have a page for Ethiopia Teff Prices, which shows the current retail price range in Addis Ababa (in Birr per kilogram) and updates it “daily”​
selinawamucii.com
. For instance, it might say “the retail price of teff in Addis Ababa ranges from ETB 41 to 167 per kg” on a given day​
selinawamucii.com
. This suggests they aggregate retail/market data (perhaps from user submissions or local partners). The data is structured as text on a webpage. An MVP could scrape this page regularly to pull the latest price range. However, one should note it gives a range rather than a single price and may combine multiple markets (Addis & Dire Dawa in their note), so it’s a starting point for reference rather than a precise figure.
Other Platforms/Apps – A few other digital tools in Ethiopia incorporate price info. For example, some mobile apps for farmers (like certain farm service apps or startup projects) might display market prices. One such platform is Lersha (a digital farming app in Ethiopia), which focuses on services but could include a market price feature as part of its offering. Another example is Trading Economics or FAO databases that sometimes list Ethiopian cereal prices (these are global data sites that might have Ethiopia’s teff price index, usually with a lag). These platforms are generally updated monthly or quarterly and are structured (spreadsheet-style data). For an MVP, they can be used as external references or linked resources. If an app has an open API or public info, the MVP could pull data automatically; if not, manual checking is needed. Always verify how current the data is – priority should be given to sources updating weekly or monthly so that the platform’s information stays fresh.
Integration and Format Considerations
When incorporating these sources, note which are structured (e.g. CSV, HTML tables, APIs) versus unstructured (PDF reports, social media text, images of boards):
Structured sources like EGTE’s website or Tridge can be scraped or downloaded regularly with minimal cleaning. For an MVP, even a simple copy-paste into a spreadsheet each week from these sources can work, given their tabular nature​
gatesopenresearch.org
.
Unstructured sources (PDF bulletins, forum posts, radio) will require manual effort – someone to read and input the numbers. Crowdsourcing can help here: you might assign volunteers to different markets or information channels to gather teff prices weekly and feed them into your platform. Over time, if patterns emerge (e.g. WFP releases a PDF on the 5th of each month), you can anticipate and plan a data update around that.
Each source above is viable for a minimal platform, especially if combined: for example, you might start with a baseline from EGTE or CSA for a historical price, then use crowdsourced Facebook/WhatsApp inputs to update the weekly current price in Addis Ababa’s markets. All data should be cited or linked on the platform for transparency, and any manual/crowdsourced figures clearly marked as such. By leveraging a mix of official data and real-time crowd inputs, your MVP can provide both credibility and freshness in tracking teff prices in Addis.

Teff Price Tracker MVP (Addis Ababa) – Project Plan
Project Overview
This project is a web-only Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an application that helps farmers and buyers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia track the market price of teff (a staple grain). The application will allow users to register/login through a central auth system, select their role (farmer or buyer), and then either submit teff price data (if authorized) or view the latest teff prices in the market. This addresses the need for up-to-date local price info – teff prices can fluctuate widely (e.g., ranging from ~ETB 41 to 167 per kg in Addis)​
selinawamucii.com
, so a transparent price-sharing platform is valuable to both producers and consumers. Key MVP features include: user authentication, role-based interface (farmers can input prices, buyers view prices), a form for manual price submission, and a simple dashboard listing recent teff prices. The focus is on a simple, responsive web UI built with React, a Node.js/Express backend API, and a database (MongoDB or Firebase) to store user info and price entries. The following sections outline the development plan, architecture, file structure, core components, and some stretch goals for the 7-day implementation timeline.
Goals and Features
User Authentication: Implement a centralized login/register system so all users can authenticate (e.g., email and password). This ensures data is protected and actions are tied to a user account.
Role Selection: During first login or registration, prompt the user to choose a role – Farmer or Buyer. This choice will customize the user experience (e.g., farmers can submit data, buyers primarily view data).
Teff Price Submission: Allow authorized users (e.g. farmers or other trusted users) to manually submit current market prices for teff in Addis Ababa via a simple form. Each submission will record the price (per quintal or kg, etc.), date, and the user who submitted it.
Price Dashboard: Provide a dashboard or feed where users (especially buyers) can view the latest teff prices submitted. This could be a table or list showing recent price entries (with date and perhaps source). It helps buyers see current market rates and farmers to verify prevailing prices.
Responsive UI: Ensure the front-end is clean and mobile-friendly, given many Ethiopian users may use smartphones. Use simple layouts (possibly with a UI library or custom minimal CSS) to support various screen sizes.
The above features constitute the core MVP that can be built and delivered in one week. Next, we detail the technology stack and a day-by-day plan to implement these features.
Tech Stack and Architecture
We will use the MERN stack – MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js – which is a popular choice for building robust web applications quickly​
dev.to
. This means a React front-end, a Node/Express back-end API, and a MongoDB database. Alternatively, Firebase can be used for the database (and even authentication), but the plan assumes MongoDB with a custom Node API for full control. Key aspects of the architecture:
Front-end: React will handle the user interface. We'll create a single-page application (SPA) with React Router for navigation (pages like Login, Role Selection, Dashboard, etc.). The UI will use React components for forms and lists. State management can be done with React's built-in tools (useState/useContext) since the app is small. We aim for a responsive design using either a lightweight CSS framework or responsive CSS in React components.
Back-end: Node.js with Express will expose RESTful API endpoints. The server will handle routes for authentication (login/register), for setting the user role, and for price data submission and retrieval. We will keep the backend logic simple (no complex business logic in MVP). JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be used for stateless auth: upon login, the server issues a JWT which the React app stores and sends with requests to protected endpoints. This “central auth” approach means one unified auth system for both roles.
Database: A cloud-hosted MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) will store user accounts and price entries. We will design two primary collections: Users (with fields like name, email, password hash, role) and Prices (with fields like amount, date, submittedBy userId, etc.). Using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM in Node makes it easy to define schemas and interact with data. (If using Firebase instead, we would use Firebase Auth for authentication and Firestore for storing price entries and user roles).
Architecture Pattern: We separate concerns following a simple MVC-like structure. The backend will have distinct layers for routes, controllers, and models (e.g., routes define API endpoints, controllers handle request logic, models handle database interaction)​
dev.to
. The front-end will similarly distinguish components for presentation and pages for different views. This modular structure keeps the project organized and maintainable.
Overall, the React client will communicate with the Express API via HTTP (possibly using the Fetch API or Axios in the React app). For instance, when a farmer submits a price, the React app sends a POST request to the /prices endpoint with the data and the user's auth token; the Node server authenticates and saves the data to MongoDB. The diagram below summarizes the flow:
User Auth Flow: React (Login form) -> POST /auth/login -> Node (verify user, respond with JWT) -> React stores token.
Role Selection Flow: React (Role form) -> POST /users/role with chosen role -> Node (update user profile in DB) -> React navigates to main app.
Price Submit Flow: React (Price form) -> POST /prices with token -> Node (verify token, save price entry) -> MongoDB (new Price document).
Dashboard Data Flow: React (Dashboard) -> GET /prices with token -> Node (verify token, fetch recent prices from DB) -> respond JSON -> React displays data.
Now that the stack and design are defined, we break down the development into a 7-day schedule.
Development Plan (One-Week Timeline)
Below is a day-by-day plan covering one week (7 days) of development. This plan assumes one developer, working roughly one main feature per day, leading to a functional MVP by the end of the week. Each day’s tasks build upon the previous day:
Day 1: Project Setup & Initialization
Project setup: Initialize a git repository and create the base structure. Set up two directories: one for the React frontend (e.g., client) and one for the Node/Express backend (e.g., server), following a typical MERN layout​
dev.to
. For example, use npx create-react-app client (or Vite) to bootstrap the React app, and run npm init -y in a server folder to start the Node project.
Dependencies: Install essential dependencies. On the front-end: React Router (for routing), maybe a UI library like Bootstrap or Material-UI (optional, for quick styling), and any state management libs if needed (not strictly necessary for MVP). On the back-end: Express, Mongoose (if using MongoDB), body-parser (if not built-in), cors (to allow the React dev server to talk to API), and maybe dotenv for configuration. If using Firebase, install Firebase SDK on front (and possibly Firebase Admin SDK on back).
Basic server scaffold: In server/index.js or server/server.js, write a minimal Express app that listens on a port and has a health-check route (e.g., GET / returns “Hello”). Set up connection to MongoDB (using connection string in an environment variable) or to Firebase. This ensures the backend is running and the DB connection works from day 1.
Basic client scaffold: Clean up the default CRA project. Set up a basic React Router with a couple of placeholder routes (e.g., /login and a protected /dashboard). Verify that you can run npm start for React and node server.js for backend without errors. Day 1 deliverable: project skeleton in place, ready to build features.
Day 2: User Authentication (Register & Login)
User model & auth logic (Backend): Implement a User model in the database. For MongoDB, define a Mongoose schema for User with fields: name, email, passwordHash, and role (role can be null or “farmer”/“buyer” initially). Set up an auth controller with routes for registration (POST /auth/register) and login (POST /auth/login). Use a library like bcrypt to hash passwords, and on login generate a JWT token (e.g. using jsonwebtoken). Store secret keys in config. If opting for Firebase Auth, configure the Firebase project and use Firebase SDK on the client to handle login (this would bypass custom JWT handling, but for this plan we assume custom JWT for learning purposes).
Auth API endpoints: Ensure that hitting the register API saves a new user (after validation that email isn’t in use), and the login API verifies credentials and returns a JWT (or session cookie). Protect the price data routes with a middleware that checks the JWT on incoming requests.
Auth front-end: Create a Login page in React. This page should provide forms for both Sign Up and Sign In (to simplify, you could either have two separate pages or a toggle form). Use controlled components for form inputs (email, password, and maybe name for register). When the user submits, call the corresponding backend API (/auth/register or /auth/login) using fetch/Axios. On successful login, store the returned token (e.g., in localStorage or in React state via Context).
Basic auth flow test: After Day 2, you should be able to register a new user and log in. After login, the token is stored and will be used in subsequent API calls. Set up React Router to redirect a logged-in user to the dashboard page. Conversely, add a simple route guard (e.g., a <RequireAuth> component) that checks for auth state/token and redirects to login if not present. This completes the authentication foundation.
Day 3: Role Selection and User Onboarding
Role selection UI: Create a Role Selection page in the front-end that allows a logged-in user (with no role yet) to choose either "Farmer" or "Buyer". This could be as simple as two buttons or radio options. For example, after a new user registers on Day 2, if their role is initially undefined in the DB, the app should navigate them to /role route where they must pick a role.
Role update backend: Implement an API endpoint like POST /users/role (or extend the user profile route) that accepts the chosen role. This will update the user’s record in the database with the selected role. If using JWT, the user’s token might now be outdated if it didn’t contain a role claim – for simplicity, you can just store role in DB and have the client fetch the user profile after setting it, or issue a new token. In an MVP, it might be acceptable to require a fresh login after role selection to get updated role info, or simply proceed knowing the role on the client side.
Enforcing role-based access: Update backend middleware or route logic so that only users with role "farmer" can submit new prices (you can check the user's role in the JWT payload or by looking up the user in DB). Buyers could be blocked from submission endpoints, for example. Similarly, both roles can access the price viewing endpoint.
Nav and routing logic: On the client, after login, route the user as appropriate: if role is not set, go to RoleSelection; if role is set, go to main Dashboard. This might involve calling an API to get the user profile (or decoding JWT if it contains role info). Once the role is selected and saved, navigate to the Dashboard. Optionally, add a simple navigation bar or header that shows the app name and perhaps the user’s name/role, with a logout button that clears auth.
Test onboarding flow: By end of Day 3, a new user should be able to register, log in, choose a role, and then land on an (albeit mostly empty) dashboard page. The system now knows the user's role and can enforce permissions in subsequent features.
Day 4: Teff Price Submission Feature
Price model (Backend): Define a Price schema/model in the database. For example, a MongoDB Mongoose schema with fields: priceAmount (Number, in ETB per a certain unit), date (Date of the market price, could default to now), submittedBy (ObjectId referencing User), and maybe location (for future multi-city support, but for now default or assume Addis Ababa). Also include a timestamp field for when the entry was created. This model will store each price submission.
Price submission API: Create an Express route for submitting a price, e.g. POST /prices. This route will:
Authenticate the user (ensure a valid JWT and maybe use the role info to allow only farmers or authorized users).
Validate input (e.g., price must be a number within a reasonable range).
Create a new Price document in the database linked to the user. Possibly auto-fill the date (or allow user to select date if they are reporting a past date, but MVP can assume current date).
Return success or the created object.
Similarly, prepare a GET /prices endpoint that returns a list of recent price entries. This can be open to all authenticated users (both buyers and farmers) since viewing data should be allowed for both roles. Optionally, implement basic query parameters on this GET (e.g., limit or sort by date) but not strictly necessary now.
Submission form (Frontend): Build the Price Submission component/page. This will likely be used by farmers. Create a form with an input for the price (in Birr). Optionally include a dropdown or note about units (e.g., per kilogram or per quintal – to keep it simple, define one standard unit in the app for now). Possibly include a date picker if allowing date selection; otherwise, assume “today’s price”. Add a textarea for any comments (optional). When the form is submitted, send a POST request to the backend (/prices API) including the entered data and the user’s auth token. After a successful submission, you could clear the form and maybe navigate to the dashboard or show a success message.
Integrate into UI: If the app design is such that the dashboard page is separate from the submission page, you might have a "Submit Price" button or link visible to farmers (and hidden for buyers) that opens the submission form page. Alternatively, the dashboard itself could contain the form for farmers at the top and a list of prices below. For clarity, this plan assumes separate pages: e.g., farmers see a navigation link to "Submit Price", whereas buyers might not see that link.
Testing: By end of Day 4, you should be able to log in as a farmer, go to the price submission form, enter a value (say "3000 ETB per quintal" - whatever format you decided), and on submission, verify that this entry is saved in the database (and retrievable via the API). Ensure that if a buyer (or not logged in user) attempts to call the submission API, they get a permission error (HTTP 403).
Day 5: Price Dashboard and Display
Price data retrieval (Backend): Ensure the GET /prices endpoint is returning data needed for the dashboard. You might sort the results by date (descending, so latest price first). Limit the number of records if needed (e.g., last 20 entries) for performance. Also consider if you want to average or collate data – but since the MVP is manual entry-focused, each entry will be shown individually (we are not building a full analytic system yet). The endpoint could also support filtering by date range or user, but those are enhancements not required for MVP.
Dashboard UI (Frontend): Build the Price Dashboard page that fetches and displays the price entries. On component mount, call the GET /prices API (with auth token). Use React state to store the list of prices. Map over the data to display it in a simple table or list. For each price entry, show at least the price amount and date. You might also show the submitter’s name or role for credibility (e.g., “Farmers Union Coop: 3200 ETB on 2025-04-22”). Keep the design simple and text-focused. Optionally, highlight the most recent price or calculate the average of the last few entries to show a quick indicator.
Conditional UI based on role: If the logged-in user is a buyer, you might default them to this dashboard view upon login. If the user is a farmer, you might also land on the dashboard but show a call-to-action like “Submit today’s price” or display their last submitted price. Essentially, both roles can see the data, but only farmers have the ability to add data. Make sure to hide any submission buttons or pages from buyers. This can be done by checking the stored user role in your React app (perhaps stored in context or derived from the JWT).
UI polish: Add basic styling to the dashboard for readability – e.g., use a simple table or card layout for price entries. Ensure it looks okay on mobile (maybe stack items or use smaller font). If time permits, you can add a small chart to visualize prices over time (using a library or simple SVG), but this is optional for MVP.
Testing and sample data: Enter a few sample price entries (as a farmer user, on different dates or different values) and then log in as a buyer user to see that those entries are visible. This tests end-to-end that the data flows from submission to display correctly. By end of Day 5, the core user journey (login -> role -> submit/view prices -> see dashboard) should be fully functional.
Day 6: Testing, Refinement, and Stretch Goals
End-to-end testing: Spend time testing all user flows. Test with different scenarios, e.g., a brand new user registering as a buyer (should go straight to an empty dashboard and not see submission options), a user registering as a farmer (should be able to submit and see their entry), invalid inputs (e.g., missing price value), and security (ensure protected routes truly require login). Fix any bugs encountered (for example, token not refreshing after role set, or form not validating empty fields).
UX improvements: Tweak the UI based on testing. For instance, add validation messages on the forms (ensure the price field is numeric, show errors if registration fails like “email already taken”, etc.). Improve navigation links (maybe add a home icon or ensure the logout works properly to clear state). Also ensure that the app is indeed responsive by testing on a mobile emulator or small browser window; adjust CSS as needed (e.g., use flexbox or grid for layouts).
Optional Feature – CSV Export: If core features are solid, implement an extra feature like exporting price data to CSV. This could be a simple button on the dashboard that, when clicked, triggers a download of the price data. Implementation: either do it client-side (format the fetched JSON into CSV string and create a blob download) or server-side (create an endpoint /prices/export that returns text/csv content with all price entries). This feature helps users (especially analysts or admins) to get the data in a spreadsheet for offline analysis.
Optional Feature – SMS Integration: Another stretch goal is SMS-based data entry. In areas with limited internet, farmers could send an SMS with the price. Implementing this in the MVP might involve using a service like Twilio. For example, set up a Twilio number and a webhook endpoint /sms in the Node backend that Twilio will call on incoming texts. Parse the SMS (e.g., expecting a format like "TEFF 3200" for price per quintal), then save to the database as a new price entry. This is an advanced feature and may require additional setup and testing. Note that such SMS systems have been used in Ethiopia – for instance, Farm Africa’s project enabled farmers to access market info via SMS, which was a “game-changer” for them​
farmafrica.org
. Our app could take inspiration from that by allowing SMS submissions.
Optional Feature – Map View: If a map view is desired (perhaps to show prices in different markets or regions), you could integrate a mapping library (like Google Maps or Leaflet). For MVP in Addis Ababa only, a map is not very necessary since all data is local, but as a proof of concept, you might display a map of Addis with a marker and pop-up showing the latest teff price. This sets the stage for scaling to multiple cities or markets later. Only attempt this if other tasks are done early.
Buffer time: Day 6 is also a buffer for any unfinished work from previous days. If any core feature is incomplete or buggy, prioritize fixing that over adding new features. By end of Day 6, you want a mostly polished app with perhaps one bonus feature implemented.
Day 7: Final Touches, Documentation, and Deployment
Code cleanup: Review the codebase for any hardcoded values, console logs, or messy sections. Refactor lightly if needed (e.g., simplify complex functions, add comments for clarity). Make sure all secrets/keys are in environment variables (for example, JWT secret, DB URL, etc.) and not in code.
Documentation: Write a README file covering how to run the project (both frontend and backend), any environment setup needed (e.g., "copy .env.example to .env and add your Mongo URI"), and how the features work. Also document any assumptions (e.g., "price is per 100 kg quintal") so users know how to interpret the data. If SMS or other integrations were added, document how to test those.
Prepare for deployment: If the goal is to make the MVP accessible, consider deploying the application:
For the backend, you can deploy to a service like Heroku, Railway, or Render easily since it’s a Node app. Ensure the environment variables (DB URL, JWT secret) are set on the server.
For the frontend, you can build the React app (npm run build) and host it on a static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or even serve it via Express by coupling the build files).
If time permits, set up a simple CI/CD or at least manual deployment so the app can be accessed by test users. This step is optional in the 7-day timeframe but good to mention.
Future planning: Spend any remaining time reflecting on possible improvements that were not done. Make notes for the next phase – e.g., enhancing security (password resets, email verification), adding unit tests, improving the UI design, etc. This ensures the project hand-off is smooth or that you have a clear roadmap if development continues.
By the end of Day 7, the MVP should be ready: a user can register, select farmer/buyer role, input teff prices (if farmer), and view a list of prices on the dashboard. The code is organized and documented, and possibly the app is deployed for stakeholder review.
Suggested File Structure
Organizing the project well helps in managing development. Below is a suggested file structure for the front-end and back-end portions of the app, following a clean separation of concerns (client vs server)​

Notes on structure: The separation into client and server directories is typical for a MERN stack project, keeping front-end and back-end code isolated​
dev.to
. In the server, we follow a simple MVC pattern: models for data, routes for endpoints, and controllers for business logic. For example, you'll have routes/priceRoutes.js that maps HTTP paths to controller functions (like PriceController.addPrice), and in models/Price.js you define the schema for a price entry. The client is structured by pages and components: pages correspond to the main screens (mapped to routes like /login, /dashboard), and components are smaller UI pieces (like a PriceTable component, or a RoleSelector component) that pages compose. This modular setup makes the app easier to extend. If using Firebase, the structure might differ slightly (e.g., no custom models for auth), but you would still separate client and an optional server (the server might just be an Express app for any extra API logic or you could skip server entirely and use Firebase Cloud Functions for submission security – however, the prompt assumes a Node server, so we keep it).
Key Components and Pages
Here are the key front-end components/pages to be built, along with their roles in the app:
LoginPage & RegisterPage: A page for user authentication. This could be a single component with conditional rendering (show login form or registration form) or two separate pages. It includes form fields for email, password (and name if registering), and handles form submission to the auth API. After successful login or signup, it redirects the user to either role selection or dashboard. This page will use state for form inputs and show error messages from the API (e.g., incorrect password).
RoleSelectionPage: An onboarding page shown to new users who haven’t chosen a role yet. It presents the option to select Farmer or Buyer (e.g., two buttons or cards describing each role). Upon selection, it calls the backend to update the user’s role (e.g., via /users/role endpoint). After saving, it redirects to the main app (dashboard). This page is only accessible to authenticated users and likely only used once per user (you might skip showing it if a role already exists).
PriceSubmissionPage (SubmitPriceForm): This page (or component) is for farmers to input new price data. It contains a form with at least one field for the price. You can include other optional fields like date (default to today) or a note, but at minimum a price value is required. On submit, it invokes the API to save the price. If using a separate page, you might navigate back to dashboard or give a success indication on the same page. If integrated into the dashboard (as a subcomponent visible to farmers), submitting could simply refresh the list of prices. This component should only render for users with the farmer role (the route could be protected on front-end, and double-checked in back-end).
DashboardPage (PriceDashboard): The main page that shows the market price data. It fetches the list of teff price entries from the server and displays them. Key elements might include:
A table or list of recent prices, including columns like Date, Price (in Birr), and perhaps the source (user or market). For MVP, since data is user-submitted, showing the submitter’s name or organization might help credibility.
If many entries, possibly a scrollable list or pagination (though MVP can just show all or last N entries).
(Optional) A filter or sort control – for example, filter by date range or show average – but not required in MVP.
For farmers, the dashboard might also include a quick link or button to "Add New Price".
For buyers, this page is essentially read-only; they open it and immediately see the latest price info.
Navigation & Misc: It’s useful to have a navigation bar or header component (especially once logged in) that shows the app name (e.g., “Teff Market Tracker”), and provides links like Dashboard, Submit Price (for farmers), and Logout. A simple implementation is to show this nav on all internal pages. Logout can just be a function that clears auth tokens and redirects to login. Additionally, a footer could be included with info or credits (not critical for MVP).
ProtectedRoute/RequireAuth: Not a page, but a component that wraps around routes that require login. This component checks if the user is authenticated (and possibly their role for certain routes) and either allows access or redirects to login. This helps prevent unauthorized access to pages like Dashboard or Submit Price.
Each of these components will be relatively simple in functionality, which is appropriate for an MVP. As the sole developer, you might create these one by one following the development plan (e.g., Login page by Day 2, RoleSelection by Day 3, etc.). They collectively deliver the core user experience.
Optional Bonus Features (Stretch Goals)
If time permits or once the core MVP is done, the following features could be added to enhance the application:
SMS-Based Data Entry: Integrate an SMS service to allow data submission via text message. This can broaden access for users who cannot go online. For example, using Twilio, you can set up a number that farmers can text with the latest teff price; a Twilio webhook will POST the message to your backend (/sms route), and you parse the text (e.g., "Teff 52 Birr") to extract the price and save it. This feature was inspired by real projects where farmers receive market info via SMS​
farmafrica.org
, and could make data input easier for those in the field. It requires additional setup (Twilio account, and some parsing logic) but can be a powerful extension.
Geographical Map View: Incorporate a map to visualize price data by location. While our MVP is focused on Addis Ababa only, this sets the stage for expansion. Using a library like Leaflet or Google Maps API, one could plot points for each market or region and display the latest teff price there. For Addis Ababa, perhaps different sub-city markets could be marked. This feature would involve adding location data to price entries (e.g., market name or coordinates). In MVP, you might simulate with one fixed location to demonstrate the concept.
Data Visualization (Charts): Add a simple chart to show price trends over time. For example, a line chart of the average daily teff price over the last month. This can be done using a chart library (like Chart.js or Recharts) and plotting the data from the price entries. It provides insight into trends and volatility. A chart could be placed on the dashboard for a quick visual cue of how prices are moving.
Export to CSV or Excel: As mentioned in the plan, providing an export function allows users to download the historical price data. This could be useful for analysts or for backup. A button that triggers CSV download from the frontend (using the data already fetched, or by hitting a dedicated API endpoint) is relatively straightforward to implement. Ensure proper CSV formatting (with headers like Date, Price, Submitter).
Admin Panel / Moderation: For data quality control, an admin interface could be created where an admin user can review, edit, or delete price submissions (in case of errors or spam). This is more relevant if the app is opened to many contributors. Implementation would involve an admin role, and additional UI to manage entries. This is likely outside the one-week MVP, but worth noting for later.
Multi-language Support: Since the app targets Ethiopia, considering Amharic (or other local languages) support could be valuable. As a stretch goal, externalize text strings and possibly integrate a library for i18n. This ensures the UI can be translated (even if manual translation is needed) for better local adoption.
Notifications: Setup email or SMS alerts to notify users of new price entries or significant price changes. For instance, a buyer might subscribe to get an alert when a new price is posted or if the price drops below a threshold. This would involve background job or polling logic and integration with an email service or using Twilio SMS for notifications.
These bonus features are optional and should only be attempted after the core MVP functionality is solid. They each address additional user needs (broader access, better data insight, etc.), and can significantly enhance the application if time permits.
Future Extensions and Data Integration
Looking beyond the MVP, the app can be extended with external data sources and automation to increase its value and accuracy:
Integration with Official Market Data: Incorporate data from government or official bodies like the Ethiopian Grain Trade Enterprise (EGTE) or the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange if they provide teff price info. For example, the World Food Programme’s price datasets for Ethiopia list EGTE as a source​
data.humdata.org
, indicating that EGTE collects market price data for staples. In the future, the app could fetch the official daily or weekly teff prices from such sources to display alongside user-submitted data. This could be done via web scraping of EGTE bulletins or through an API if available.
FEWS NET Data Feeds: Leverage data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which monitors staple food prices in countries like Ethiopia​
knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu
. FEWS NET has historical price data (e.g., a weekly dataset since 2019 for Ethiopian staples including teff)​
data.humdata.org
. We could import this historical data to show trends or to backfill our database. Additionally, setting up a periodic job to fetch new FEWS NET price updates would keep the app’s data in sync with broader market trends.
Global Market Integration (Tridge, etc.): Platforms like Tridge provide commodity price intelligence and could be integrated to compare local prices with global market prices. For instance, if Tridge or similar services have an API for teff price or export data, the app could display how Addis Ababa’s prices compare to other regions or export markets​
tridge.com
​
tridge.com
. This would be a later-phase feature for advanced users.
Automated Web Scraping: In absence of official APIs, a scraping mechanism could be built to pull data from websites or reports. For example, if the Ethiopian government publishes monthly market price reports as PDFs, the app could parse those (with user confirmation) to update the database. Care must be taken with scraping (legality and reliability), but it can automate the data entry that is manual in the MVP.
Scale to Other Crops and Regions: While the MVP focuses on teff in Addis Ababa, the architecture can extend to other commodities (maize, wheat, etc.) and other markets in Ethiopia. This would involve adding categories for crops and a location field for markets. The database schema for prices might then include commodity and market fields. The UI could allow switching between commodities or selecting regions on a map. This scalability is a natural next step once the teff/Addis use-case is validated.
Mobile App or Offline Mode: Given many users in the target demographic might have intermittent connectivity, a future extension could be developing a mobile app (using React Native or as a PWA – Progressive Web App) for offline usage. Users could save data offline and sync when online, or get cached last-known prices even without connection. This would increase the practicality of the tool on the ground.
In summary, the MVP can evolve from a simple manual-entry app into a comprehensive market information system by integrating trusted data sources and expanding features. The current one-week project lays the groundwork by delivering the essential functionality and a scalable tech stack. With additional iterations, this app could significantly empower Ethiopian farmers and buyers with information – much like how other digital initiatives have improved market transparency in the region​
